# AI Conversational Bot

## Description
This is a WEB Application based Bot which uses WebSpeechAPI for Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text, and Huggingface conversational AI model to interact with the user. The user can interact with the bot by speaking to it. The bot will respond to the user's query by speaking back to the user. Since, it is not powered by the new LLMs such gpt-turbo or da-vinci, it is not very accurate. But, it is still fun to play with.
